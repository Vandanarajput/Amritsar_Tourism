        <h2 class="section-title">The Origin of Amritsar</h2>
        <p>Guru Ram Das, the fourth Sikh Guru, was born as Bhai Jetha on 24 September 1534 in Lahore (now in Pakistan).
          Orphaned at a young age, he was raised by a kind woman who instilled in him the values of hard work and faith.
        </p>
        <p>As a young man, he met Guru Amar Das, the third Sikh Guru, and became his devoted disciple. He later married
          Bibi Bhani, the daughter of Guru Amar Das, and became an integral part of the Guru's family. Impressed by his
          humility, devotion, and dedication to service, Guru Amar Das appointed him as his successor in 1574, giving
          him the name Guru Ram Das.</p>
        <p>As Guru, he made significant contributions to Sikhism and laid the foundation for what would become the
          spiritual and cultural heart of the Sikh community. He selected the site for a new settlement and began
          constructing a sacred tank called <em>Amrit Sarovar</em>, or "Pool of Nectar." Around this tank grew a town
          that would eventually become the city of Amritsar.</p>
        <p>Guru Ram Das passed away on 1 September 1581, but his legacy lives on through the city of Amritsar, which
          stands as a testament to his vision and spiritual leadership.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">British Colonial Period</h2>
        <p>The British colonial era marked a significant and often painful chapter in Amritsar's history. The city
          became a center of resistance against colonial rule, with its residents actively participating in India's
          struggle for independence.</p>
        <p>The darkest day in Amritsar's colonial history was April 13, 1919, when British troops under General Dyer
          opened fire on a peaceful gathering at Jallianwala Bagh, killing hundreds of unarmed civilians who had
          assembled for a festival. This unprovoked massacre became a turning point in India's freedom movement,
          galvanizing nationalist sentiment across the country.</p>
        <p>Throughout the remainder of British rule, Amritsar continued to be a significant site for nationalist
          activities. The city's strategic importance, both as a cultural center and as a border city close to Pakistan,
          ensured its prominence in the political landscape of pre-independence India.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Modern Amritsar</h2>
        <p>Today, Amritsar stands as a vibrant city that beautifully blends its rich historical heritage with
          contemporary development. The Golden Temple (Harmandir Sahib) remains the spiritual epicenter, attracting
          millions of visitors from around the world each year.</p>
        <p>Beyond its religious significance, Amritsar has evolved into an important commercial hub. The city is
          renowned for its textile industry, especially for Punjabi suits, shawls, and blankets. Its culinary scene is
          famous worldwide, with specialties like Amritsari kulcha, fish, and various Punjabi delicacies drawing food
          enthusiasts from everywhere.</p>
        <p>The Wagah Border ceremony, held daily at the India-Pakistan border near Amritsar, has become a patriotic
          spectacle symbolizing the complex relationship between the two nations. Modern Amritsar continues to play a
          crucial role in Indo-Pak relations due to its proximity to the border.</p>
        <p>Despite facing numerous challenges throughout its history, Amritsar remains resilient‚Äîa testament to the
          enduring spirit of its people and their dedication to preserving their cultural identity while embracing
          progress.</p>
